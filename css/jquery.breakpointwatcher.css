/*
 * you'll also need to add rules for the breakpointwatcher's indicator elements
 * for every view, a div is created with attribute data-view set to the view's name
 * for maintenance, it's preferable to do this where you define the media queries
 * for your global layout
 *
 * like this:

	.breakpointwatcher[data-view="large"] {
		display: block;
	}
	.breakpointwatcher[data-view="small"] {
		display: none;
	}

 	@media screen and (max-width: 39.9999em) {
		.breakpointwatcher[data-view="large"] {
			display: none;
		}
		.breakpointwatcher[data-view="small"] {
			display: block;
		}
	}
